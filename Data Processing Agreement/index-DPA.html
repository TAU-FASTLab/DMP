                  The Data Processor shall be authorised to process personal data under this Agreement for as long as the Data Processor provides
                  the Data Controller with the services specified in the Procurement Contract.
                </p>

              <h3>6. General obligations of the Data Controller</h3>
                <p>
                  The Data Controller shall act as the data controller referred to in the Data Protection Laws.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Data Controller determines the purposes for which and the manner in which personal data are processed. The Data Controller shall be

                The Data Processor shall comply with the procedures and regulations set out in the Data Protection Laws regarding the processing and
                protection of personal data. The Data Pro-cessor shall ensure that the services provided under this Agreement comply with the Data Protection
                Laws, the provisions set out in the Procurement Contract and, in particular, the regulations concerning data protection by design and default.
                <p>
                  The Data Processor shall implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure that personal data are processed on behalf of the
                  Data Controller in accordance with the Procurement Contract and the practices agreed between the Parties. The pur-pose of the technical and 
                  organisational measures is to guarantee that personal data are lawfully processed and to ensure the ongoing confidentiality, integrity, 
                  availability and resil-ience of processing systems and services.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The Data Processor shall not process or otherwise exploit personal data received under the Procurement Contract for purposes other than that
                  which is strictly necessary for the performance of its obligations under the Procurement Contract.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The Data Processor shall designate a data processing officer or a contact person who will serve as a point of contact that handles all requests

                  The Data Processor shall process personal data on behalf of the Data Controller. The Da-ta Processor warrants that it has the necessary expertise
                  and resources to process per-sonal data in compliance with the Data Protection Laws and protect the rights of data sub-jects. The Data Processor 
                  hereby guarantees that all the appropriate technical and organ-isational measures relating to the processing of personal data are taken in 
                  compliance with the Data Protection Laws and the provisions set forth herein.  
                </p>

              <h3>8. Use of subprocessors</h3>
                <p>
                  The Data Processor may not subcontract the performance of any of the services hereun-der to another data processor (hereinafter “Subprocessor”) without
                  the Data Controller’s explicit prior written consent. The Data Processor shall inform the Data Controller of any and all intended changes concerning 
                  the addition or replacement of Subprocessors, thereby giving the Data Controller the opportunity to object to such changes. A Subpro-cessor may not 
                  process personal data on behalf of the Data Controller until the Data Con-troller has approved said Subprocessor. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Data Processor shall ensure that its Subprocessor complies with the data protection obligations referred to herein and signs a written data
                  processing agreement. The Data Processor shall remain fully liable and responsible for any action, omission or negligence of its Subprocessor.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Data Processor shall, at the Data Controller’s request, promptly provide the Data Controller with a list of all its Subprocessors and the 
                  locations where personal data are processed.   
                </p>

              <h3>9. Guidelines for processing personal data</h3>
                <p>
                  The Data Processor hereby agrees to only process personal data in accordance with doc-umented instructions provided by the Data Controller and
                  only to the extent specified therein. The Data Processor shall ensure that all persons who are acting under the author-ity of the Data Processor
                  and have access to the personal data referred to in this Agree-ment only process personal data in strict compliance with the instructions provided
                  by the Data Controller.
                </p>
                <p>
                  When the Procurement Contract comes into force, the Procurement Contract and its ap-pendices (including this Agreement) shall constitute the Data
                  Controller’s instructions re-ferred to herein. During the term of the Procurement Contract, the Data Controller may provide the Data Processor with
                  amended, updated or revised instructions concerning the processing of personal data.The Data Processor hereby agrees to comply with any amended, 
                  updated or revised instructions provided by the Data Controller. If compliance with amended, updated or revised instructions necessitates measures
                  that significantly exceed the level specified in the Data Protection Laws and the Data Processor incurs more than minor additional expenses for 
                  taking the necessary measures, the Data Pro-cessor shall be entitled to receive reasonable compensation, as agreed in advance be-tween the Parties,
                  for the additional work. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Data Processor shall ensure that all persons who are acting under the authority of the Data Processor and have access to the personal data 
                  referred to in this Agreement are aware of their obligations pertaining to the processing of personal data and only process personal data in accordance
                  with the Procurement Contract, the terms and conditions set out in this Agreement and the instructions provided by the Data Controller.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Data Processor shall notify the Data Controller forthwith if the instructions provided by the Data Controller, in the Data Processor’s opinion, 
                  are incomplete or violate the Data Protection Laws. Upon receipt of such notice, the Data Controller shall review the instruc-tions and promptly provide
                  the Data Processor with revised instructions or a written con-firmation that the original instructions comply with the Data Protection Laws.
                </p>

              <h3>10. Obligation to assist and data subjects’ right of access</h3>
                <p>
                  The Data Processor shall, upon the Data Controller’s request, provide the Data Controller with all the information that the Data Controller needs to demonstrate
                  compliance with the data protection regulations and fulfilment of the Data Controller’s obligations. The Data Processor shall, among other things, document all 
                  processing activities performed under this Agreement and the Procurement Contract in an electronic format and, upon the Data Controller’s request, promptly provide
                  the Data Controller with information about pro-cessing activities. The Data Processor shall be obligated to assist the Data Controller with preparing and maintaining
                  descriptions and documents, such as data protection impact assessments, and conducting prior consultations as set out in the GDPR.    
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Data Processor shall take appropriate technical and organisational measures to assist the Data Controller in the fulfilment of the Data Controller’s obligations 
                  under the Data Pro-tection Laws pertaining to data subject rights. The Data Processor agrees to promptly noti-fy the Data Controller of any subject access requests 
                  made by data subjects. The Data Processor shall not respond to subject access requests. The Data Processor shall assist the Data Controller in fulfilling its obligation
                  to respond to subject access requests. To help the Data Controller respond to subject access requests, the Data Processor may have to, for example, assist the Data 
                  Controller in communicating with data subjects, enforcing da-ta subject rights, rectifying or deleting personal data, restricting the processing of personal data, 
                  or transferring a data subject’s personal data to a different IT environment.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Any expenses incurred by the Data Processor in meeting the obligations referred to herein shall be included in the service fee specified in the Procurement Contract.
                  If, however, compliance with the obligation to assist the Data Controller necessitates measures that significantly exceed the level specified in the Data Protection 
                  Laws and the Data Proces-sor incurs more than minor additional expenses in the course of taking these measures, the Data Processor shall be entitled to receive 
                  reasonable compensation, as agreed in advance between the Parties, for the additional work.
                </p>

              <h3>11. Information security</h3>
                <p>
                  The Data Processor hereby agrees to comply with the information security requirements set out in the Procurement Contract and the 
                  Data Protection Laws and implement appro-priate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to 
                  the risks presented by the Data Processor’s processing activities. While assessing the ap-propriate level of security, the Data 
                  Processor must consider the risks presented by pro-cessing and, in particular, the protection of personal data from accidental or 
                  unlawful de-struction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure or unauthorised access.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Data Processor shall without undue delay notify the Data Controller of any suspicions that a personal data breach has taken 
                  place or is currently taking place. The Data Proces-sor’s notification of a personal data breach must include sufficient and 
                  comprehensive in-formation about the breach, including a description of the personal data breach, the impact of the personal 
                  data breach, the measures that have or will be taken in response to the personal data breach and other details requested by 
                  the Data Controller. The Data Pro-cessor shall also report to the Data Controller all processing activities that violate the 
                  Data Protection Laws, the Procurement Contract, this Agreement or the instructions provided by the Data Controller.
                </p>

              <h3>12. Data Controller’s right to conduct data protection audits</h3>
                <p>
                  The Data Controller, or an auditor authorised by the Data Controller, shall be entitled to perform audits and inspections that are
                  necessary to confirm the compliance of the Data Processor and possible Subprocessors with their obligations under the Data 
                  Protection Laws. The Data Processor shall ensure that its Subprocessors sign agreements that en-sure that the Data Controller
                  is also authorised to audit the Data Processor’s Subproces-sors. An audit may include, among other things, requests for 
                  information, inspections and other applicable audit activities. The Data Processor shall ensure that data protection au-dits can
                  also cover its Subprocessors that process personal data on behalf of the Data Controller to deliver the services specified in 
                  the Procurement Contract. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  Audits may be conducted once a year unless the Data Controller has a valid reason for conducting audits more frequently. 
                  The Data Processor undertakes to assist the Data Controller with audits and participate in them. The Data Controller shall 
                  be responsible for its own and the auditor’s expenses incurred in the course of data protection audits. The Data Processor 
                  shall be responsible for its own expenses incurred in the course of data protection audits.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Audits shall, if possible, be conducted during the Data Processor’s normal opening times and with as little inconvenience to 
                  the Data Processor as possible. In case any problems or weaknesses are detected during an audit, the Data Processor shall be
                  responsible for resolving the problems or weaknesses at its own expense.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Alternatively, the Data Processor may, with the Data Controller’s prior consent, demon-strate its regulatory compliance by 
                  presenting an up-to-date audit report or certificate is-sued by an external, independent and impartial auditor.
                </p>
                
              <h3>13. Transfer of personal data</h3>
                <p>
                  The Data Processor may not transfer personal data outside the EEA, or make personal data held in the EEA accessible in countries
                  outside the EEA, without the Data Controller’s prior written consent. The Data Processor shall ensure that a possible transfer 
                  of personal data outside the EEA, or the provision of access to personal data in countries outside the EEA, is conducted in 
                  compliance with the Data Protection Laws.  
                </p>

                <h3>14. Confidentiality</h3>
                <p>
                  The Data Processor undertakes to treat in strict confidence all personal data, and all in-formation related to the processing thereof,
                  to which the Data Processor gains access pursuant to this Agreement or the Procurement Contract. The confidentiality obligations shall
                  survive the termination or expiration of the Procurement Contract.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Data Processor warrants and undertakes that all persons who are working under the authority of the Data Processor and are authorised
                  to process the personal data referred to in this Agreement agree to strictly comply with the confidentiality obligations referred to
                  herein or are under an appropriate statutory obligation of confidentiality.
                </p>                

              <h3>15. Liability</h3>
                <p>
                  The Data Processor shall be solely and fully liable for any losses, damages or costs in-curred by the Data Controller, a data subject or
                  a third party due the Data Processor’s breach of the obligations set forth in this Agreement or in the Data Protection Laws. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Data Processor shall be liable for any and all damages and costs resulting from cor-ruption, destruction or loss of personal data or
                  other materials held by the Data Controller, including costs associated with restoring or recreating such data. 
                </p>
                <p>

            <p>The Parties will assess in co-operation the risks related to the processing of personal data prior to collecting personal data.</p>
            <p>If the risk assessment implies that the planned processing activities are likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the Parties shall, prior to the collecting personal data, carry out in co-operation a data protection impact assessment (“DPIA”) as stipulated in Article 35 of the GDPR. Both the risk assessment and, where required, the DPIA shall be documented and reviewed periodically.</p>
            <p>Where the planned processing would require prior consultation of supervisory authority in accordance with Article 36 of the GDPR, the Parties agree that
