    <div class="form-title"><h1>Ethic Review Request Template</h1></div>

    <p>The request for statement that you send to the Ethics Committee must include numbered sections in the following order. Write your request in clear and understandable language. </p>  

    <h2> 1. Cover letter </h2>
    <p>The cover letter should includes the following information:</p>
    <p>Contact information of the principal investigator; grounds for submitting the request for statement:</p>
    <p>The researcher must request an ethical review statement from a human sciences ethics committee, 
        if their research contains any of the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li> a) Participation in the research deviates from the principle of informed consent.</li>
        <li> b) The research involves intervening in the physical integrity of research participants.</li>
        <li> c) The focus of the research is on minors under the age of 15, without separate consent from a parent or carer or without informing a parent or carer
             in a way that would enable them to prevent the child’s participation in the research.</li>
        <li>d) Research that exposes participants to exceptionally strong stimuli.</li>
        <li>e) Research that involves a risk of causing mental harm that exceeds the limits of normal daily life to the research participants or their family members or others close to them.</li>
        <li>f) Conducting the research could involve a threat to the safety of participants or researchers or their family members or others close to them.</li>
    </ul>         
         
    <p> Please also note that if you are researching children/youths under the age of 15, the research does not automatically require a prior ethical assessment. Ethical pre-assessment is only required when parental or guardian consent is not required or when one of the above-mentioned points, a-f, requires it.
    </p>
    <p>   
        If the research contains any of the factors above and the research has not undergone ethical review, this may constitute a violation of responsible conduct of research (RCR) and, where necessary, it may be resolved through the process of handling allegations of research misconduct.
    <p>      
        An ethical review statement may also be requested when a funding body, collaborative partner, research object or publisher so requests. However, it must be noted that a statement cannot be requested once the research has commenced. Where research is carried out or data is gathered outside Finland, the researcher must familiarise themselves with the ethical review practices in the target country.
    </p>
    <p>
        Remember to clearly state the reason for the opinion request in the cover letter. The opinion request must be based on points a-f or on the request of the financier or the scientific journal. The grantor of the research permit may also require a prior ethical assessment. Do not send a request for an opinion if the research design, funder, scientific journals or the grantor of the research permit do not require an ethical assessment.
    </p>   
        If you need a statement request for a reason other than the one mentioned above, you can request descriptions of the ethical principles.
    </p> 
    <p> 
        Possible reason to maintain confidentiality. The Ethics Committee is committed to promoting the openness of ethical reviews but will keep the information confidential if, for example, confidentiality is required in the contracts signed with your financier. This confidentiality obligation will apply to the information that is generally published on the Committee’s website (namely the grounds for requesting a statement, your assessment of the ethical considerations, the research abstract and the decision made by the Ethics Committee) – other information and documents reviewed by the Ethics Committee are not public.
    </p>

    <h2> 2. Research Plan </h2>
    <p> The research proposal (with the pages numbered). The abstract must be written in Finnish if the language of the study is English. 
        The research plan is drafted for the purpose of ethics evaluation by the committee. The maximun length of research plan is 10 pages. 
        The research plan must be drafted according to the following instruction: 
        <a href="https://content-webapi.tuni.fi/proxy/public/2022-05/instruction.research.plan_.docx">Instruction Research Plan</a>
    </p>

    <h2> 3. Assessment of the ethical considerations by the principal investigator </h2>

        <p>You should assess the ethical risks and potential harm that are associated with participating in your study and exceed what people may expect to experience in
            their everyday life. The ethical assessment should be carried out in accordance with the principles set out in the 
            <a href="https://www.tenk.fi/sites/tenk.fi/files/Ihmistieteiden_eettisen_ennakkoarvioinnin_ohje_2019.pdf"> Ethical principles of research with human 
            participants and ethical review in the human sciences in Finland issued by the Finnish National Board on Research Integrity </a> (TENK, 2019).</p>
        <p>
            In this context, the research setting must be evaluated in relation to ethical principles: for example, mental harm that crosses the boundaries of everyday life
            in relation to the prohibition of harm. Whether too invasive questions or strong stimuli used in research can cause harm or if the person is asked too personal
            things; is the principle of privacy protection violated in this case.
        </p>
        <p>
            If the principle of informed consent is deviated from unnecessarily or without clear justification, how does this relate to the principle of self-determination.
        </p>
        <p> In this context, tell us about the ethical aspects of the research (e.g. the nature of the interview or questionnaire questions in relation to ethical principles)
            or the research situation or research space from the perspective of ethical principles.
        </p>
        <p>     
        In this context, you can also briefly state the risks associated with the processing of personal data in relation to ethical principles, but the actual risks associated
            with the processing of personal data are assessed in the risk assessment section, and if the processing of personal data causes a high risk, a so-called impact
            assessment.
        </p>
        <p>This assessment should not focus on the RCR Guidelines of the Finnish National Board of Research Integrity (TENK) as these guidelines discuss research ethics
            and violations of scientific integrity on a more general level.
        </p>

    <h2>4. Risk assessment</h2>

    <p>A concise assessment of the risks associated with the processing of personal data must always be carried out before starting to process personal data. 
        In this section of your request for statement, you need to assess the risks related to data protection and privacy. 
        <a href="https://tietosuoja.fi/en/risk-assessment-and-data-protection-planning"> See more instructions on the website of the Data Protection Ombudsman.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
        Please be aware that the concise risk assessment concerns the processing of all personal data, not only special category data.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) </h2>
    <p>If the results of a concise risk assessment indicate that participation in your study will pose significant risks to research subjects from the perspective
         of privacy, you must carry out an impact assessment pertaining to the processing of personal data. 
         <a href="https://tietosuoja.fi/en/impact-assessments">see more information on website of the Office of the Data Protection Ombudsman. </a> </p>


    <h2>6. Information Sheet and Privacy Notice </h2>
        <p>a. If you intend to deviate from the principle of informed consent, the reasons for this choice must be presented in the section where you assess the ethical considerations of your study.</p>

        <p>b. <em>Privacy notice</em> If you will be <a href="https://www.tuni.fi/en/research/responsible-research/data-protection">processing personal data</a> 
            (NB! The concept of personal data is extensive) in connection with your study. You must also draw up a privacy notice if your data is likely to include personal 
            data, even if the collection of personal data is not the primary purpose of your study. The privacy notice must be attached to the subject information sheet. 
            The privacy notice may include some of the same details as the subject information sheet. See the link below for information that&nbsp;a privacy notice&nbsp;
            must include.
        </p>
        
        <p>Please note that "consent" at the point 10 of the privacy notice for scientific research (lawful basis for processing personal data) does not mean consent for 
            participating in the research but consent for the processing of personal data (the consent form that concerns participation in the study is mentioned in the 
            point 7 of this guideline).&nbsp; The ethics committee recommends that instead of consent, the legal basis for the processing of personal data is "public 
            interest or the exercise of official authority" and more specifically "scientific or historical research purposes", meaning that if you choose this point as the
            legal basis for your research, you should tick both boxes. However, it must be noted that it is the research who decides the legal basis for the processing of
            personal data suitable for their scientific research; these are public interest with the above mentioned specification or consent. Do not tick two boxes.&nbsp;
        </p>
        
        <p>If you process special categories of personal data (=sensitive personal data), please also tick point 11. If you process them, please tick the boxes. if special
            categories of personal data are not te actual research topic, meaning you do not ask questions about, for example, people´s health in an interview or a survey,
            but such things may come up in an interview, tick the relevant box, for example health data. Please then write the following text in brackets next to in an 
            interview, they will be removed, because they are not a legal basis for the processing of personal data in this research.&nbsp;
        </p>

        <p>A set out in the <a href="https://www.tuni.fi/fi/tutkimus/vastuullinen-tiede/hyva-tieteellinen-kaytanto">privacy policy</a>&nbsp;of Tampere University, the lawful basis for processing personal data should generally be public task.</p>

        <p>Please also see the <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/FI/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32016R0679">EU’s General Data Protection Regulation, Articles 13 and 14</a>.</p>


        <h2>7.The consent form</h2>
        
        <p>To be signed by your research subjects or other statement detailing the process of obtaining and documenting participants’ consent. 
            The Ethics Committee recommends researchers to use written consent forms if their study intervenes in the physical integrity of their subjects 
            (if the study falls outside the scope of the Medical Research Act) and if the research data will not be anonymised before analysis and the data
             contains sensitive information (special category data defined in the GDPR).</p>

        <p>Please note that instead of a signed consent form, you can ask the research participants for verbal consent. However, remember to document the 
            verbal consent immediately after receiving it (=remember to mark it in the research documents and file). However, see above for situations where
             the Committee recommends taking written consent.</p>
        
        <p>Please note! Under content of the research register in the privacy notice, also indicate that you have documented the oral consent you have been given
             and mention this in your request for a statement in the section where you are wite about consent to participate in the research."</p>
        
        <p>If you request permission from parents or guardians for their child’s participation in your study, the consent form must be appended to the request 
            for statement. If research subjects are unable to provide informed consent due to a mental disorder, disability or other similar reason, you must 
            request consent from their guardians or legal representatives. This consent form must also be appended to the request for statement.</p>


    <h2>8. Other material </h2>
    <p>Other material provided to research subjects (interview framework, diaries, questionnaires, etc.).</p>

    <h2>9. Data Management Plan (DMP) </h2>

    <ul>
        <li>The data used in the study and a concise description of how the data have been collected.</li>
        <li>Technical solutions, applications and storage facilities used in data management.</li>

        <li>Justify your answers and the decisions you have made from the perspective of research ethics and privacy protection.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>10.  After the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) came into force, it is no longer necessary to prepare research data
         files that were formerly required.</h2>
         
         <p>However, you must prepare a GDPR-compliant <strong><em>record </em></strong>of processing activities.</p>
          You do not have to send this document to the Ethics Committee but you must have it ready. The Ethics Committee may request to see your 
          privacy notice to look into potential data protection issues associated with your study.

             by the Office of the Data Protection Ombudsman.</a></p>

        <p>PLEASE NOTE! Your request for statement must include a table of contents with the above sections from 1 to 9.</p>

        <p>The committee may require resubmission of the request for statement/research plan, if there are clear and significant ethical issues concerning the information sheet for research participants, the consent form, the data management plan, the planned data protection practices, the ethical assessment carried out by the researcher and/or the planned research methods. The decision whether to require resubmission will be made on a case by case basis following an overall assessment of the research plan. Resubmission is generally required if there are multiple issues that must be addressed.</p>

<h3>Guidelines for the ethical review</h3>

<p>In human sciences, the consideration of research ethics mainly focuses on the encounters between the researcher and his or her research subjects that may include unexpected elements. Researchers always hold sole responsibility for the ethical and moral choices they make while conducting research.</p>

<p><strong>Ethical reviews will especially focus on the following elements of your proposed study: </strong>What are the risks and hazards (as described in your request for statement) that your study may potentially cause to your research subjects, their family members and to the researchers involved? Considering the measures taken to minimise risks, how likely are the risks? Will research subjects be provided with sufficiently clear information about the study, their participation and the processing of personal data? Is the data management plan sufficient, and does it include a description of the processing of personal data throughout the research lifecycle? Do you have an appropriate written or electronic consent form to be signed by your research subjects? If you will not be using a written or electronic consent form, how will you request research subjects to participate in your study and how will you document their consent? How would you weigh the importance of the expected findings against the potential hazards and risks associated with your study?</p>

<p>When research falls in the category of human sciences, the weighing of the expected benefits against potential risks is not as straightforward as a cost/benefit analysis but more like a normative assessment of different values. The purpose of the ethical review is to ensure that all the potential risks are eliminated, if possible, without compromising the scientific value of the study. The next step is to assess whether the risks that cannot be eliminated can be considered morally acceptable. The threshold for morally acceptable risk may be increased, if your study is expected to produce significant scientific value and will cause no harm to your research subjects (=studies where the requirement to obtain informed consent has been waived), or if your research subjects are considered able to assess the potential risks based on the information provided to them.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>If your study will be carried out in compliance with the principle of respecting the autonomy of research subjects and is not expected to give rise to mental distress that goes beyond normal everyday life, you must clearly state so in your request for statement. Then the Ethics Committee will primarily focus on assessing the information provided to your prospective research subjects and reviewing data protection and privacy issues.</p>

<p>If your study involves a <em>significant risk of violating the autonomy of your research subjects</em> or <em>may potentially harm your research subjects in ways that cannot be assessed without special expertise</em>, the research methods to be employed in your study will be assessed in relation to your research questions and the importance of the new information that your study is expected to generate. &nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Informing your research subjects </strong></p>

<p>The Ethics Committee will verify that you have drawn up an appropriate plan for informing your research subjects of the study. At least the information listed above must be included in the information sheet delivered to your subjects.</p>

<p>If you will be conducting experimental research, you will be expected to provide sufficiently detailed information about your proposed research protocol. The typical setting of experimental research varies greatly between disciplines. The Ethics Committee will assess whether the information is sufficient on a case-by-case basis.</p>

<p>If a study will intervene with the physical integrity of research subjects, they must be informed of the study in accordance with the applicable guidelines set out in the Medical Research Act.</p>

<p><strong>Privacy and data protection</strong></p>

<p>The Ethics Committee will review your data management plan and ensure that you are prepared to take appropriate technical data protection measures. Your data management plan must describe:&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
	<li>the measures that will be taken to protect or erase personally identifiable information</li>
	<li>possible confidentiality agreements that must be signed before processing personally identifiable information</li>
	<li>the plan to retain research data for future research purposes or appropriately dispose of the data after the study has been concluded</li>
</ol>

<p>The Ethics Committee will not assess the data protection policies of scientific publications in advance. Researchers and the editorial boards of journals are responsible for considering the ethical issues relating to research papers.</p>
